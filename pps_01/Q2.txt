Consider the Dumbo program given below.

i.    Use locations A, B;
 ii.    Output "Give A and B: ";
iii.    Input A; Input B;
 iv.    A = A + B;
  v.    B = A + B;
 vi.    Output "B is: ";
vii.    Output B;

Suppose the user provides 10 and 20 as the values of A and B respectively when
Dumbo executes the above instructions. What value will be output by Dumbo after printing "B is: "?

SOLUTION

The instruction use locations A, B instruct dumbo to use 2 different memory location and labeled
it with A and B.

dumbo will now print the string i.e. "Give A and B: " to the standard output device

dumbo will take input and store value to memory location labeled with A.

dumbo will now take the next input B and stores to the memory location labeled with B.

dumbo now start summing up A + B i.e. according to question 10 and 20 and stores back to A

now dumbo start summing up A + B and store back to B

dumbo now notify user what is printing by returning string in screen as  Output "B is: "

dumbo prints the value of B;


Lets see with some handy work

A = 10 and B = 20

A = 10 + 20

A = 30

B = A + B

B = 30 + 20

B = 50

dumbo will print 50;
