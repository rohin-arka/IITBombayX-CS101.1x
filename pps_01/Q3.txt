In sign-magnitude representation, what is the integer equivalent of the binary number 11110100 ?

SOLUTION

11110100

MSB(most significant bit) = 1

Thus number is negative as its MSB is 1 and 1 represent negative.

now converting binary to decimal number system

1110100 = 1 * 2^6 + 1 * 2^5 + 1 * 2^4 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0
        = 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0
        = 116

The msb is 1 so -116 is the answer
