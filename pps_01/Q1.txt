Consider the Dumbo program given below.

  Use locations NBOYS, NGIRLS, NSTUDENTS;
  NBOYS = 35;
  NGIRLS = 124;
  NSTUDENTS = 80;
  Input NBOYS;
  Input NGIRLS;
  Output NSTUDENTS;
  NSTUDENTS = NBOYS + NGIRLS;

Suppose the user types 12 and 28 as input values for the locations NBOYS and NGIRLS respectively.
The output value displayed by Dumbo on our monitor screen will be

SOLUTION
--------

3 memory location will be reserved by dumbo's with label NBOYS, NGIRLS, NSTUDENTS respectively

store 35 in the memory location label NBOYS
store 123 in memory location label NGIRLS
store 80 in the memory location label NSTUDENTS

dumbo now takes the user input 12 and 28 and store in the memory location which already is being
labeled as NBOYS and NGIRLS respectively

prints the NSTUDENTS which contains the integer value 80

Finally dumbos sum up NBOYS and NGIRLS and stores in memory location labeled with NSTUDENTS

so the answer is 80;
