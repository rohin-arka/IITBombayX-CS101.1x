int main() {
    int d = 19;
    int m = 9;
    int y = 4180;
    int c = 2;
    int val;
    val = ( d + m + y + (y/4) + c) % 7;
    cout << val;
    return 0;
}

What value will be printed by the statement 'cout << val'. Write your numerical answer
in the textbox given below. Please make sure that you do not enter any space in the textbox.

Answer: 5

Here precedence in arithmetic operators come as below
(19 + 9 + 4180 + (4180 / 4) + 2) % 7
= (19 + 9 + 4180 + 1045 + 2) % 7
= 5255 % 7
= 5
