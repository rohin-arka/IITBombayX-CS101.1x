Consider the Dumbo program given below.

Use locations PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, MATHS, PCM;
PHYSICS = 67;
CHEMISTRY = 56;
MATHS = 35;
PCM = 158;
Input PHYSICS;
Input CHEMISTRY;
Input MATHS;
Output PCM;
PCM = PHYSICS + CHEMISTRY + MATHS;

Suppose the user types 65, 58, and 90 as input values for the locations PHYSICS,
CHEMISTRY, and MATHS respectively. The output value displayed by Dumbo on our
monitor screen will be

4 different memory location are reserved with label PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, MATHS and PCM

integer are store in the memory location with label are below.

PHYSICS = 67, CHEMISTRY = 56, MATHS = 35, PCM = 158.

Dumbo now takes user input 65 and stores to the memory location label 67;

takes user input 58 and stores in the CHEMISTRY

takes user input 90 and stores in the memory location MATHS

Lets recall what values are saved in the memory location with the user input

PHYSICS = 65, CHEMISTRY = 58, MATHs = 90, PCM = 158;

Dumbo now prints the value of PCM i.e. 158.

Dumbo finally sun up three values from three different memory location and finally stores in PCM as

PCM = 65 + 58 + 90;

Now PCM new value is 213 but there is no instruction to print for dumbo.
