Consider the Dumbo program given below.

i.  Use locations A, B;
ii.  Output "Give A and B: ";
iii.  Input A; Input B;
iv.  A = B;
 v.  B = A * B;
vi.  Output "B is: ";
vii.  Output B;


What should be the value typed by the user as input for location B, so that the
output produced is "B is: 361"?

Two different memory location is reserved with the label A and B

prints the string "Give A and B: "

takes the user input and stores in the memory location label with A

takes the user input from standard input device and stores in the memory location B

the user input is again replaced by the user input value B

now value of a equals to value of b

B = A * B;

the multiplication of both same value is assigned back to the B

and B is printed

so here important point is A = B

so dividing 361/2 answer is 180.5
